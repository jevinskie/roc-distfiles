# Distfiles for Roc Toolkit

This repo provides tarballs and patches for Roc Toolkit dependencies.

It is used as an optional submodule of roc-toolkit repo. If the submodule is checked out, the build system wont have to download anything. The primary motivation for this is to avoid downloading dependencies on Travis, since it has problems with network connectivity during build.
